## eFlow 5 -Installation of version 5.0.3 ##

### Question/ description: ###
What is the correct procedure to upgrade to version 5.0.3

### Answer: ###
Regarding the installation process of 5.0.3, I want to clarify the following points:



1. Upgrade is not available from the prerelease version to the official release version - you have to delete all the databases, to uninstall the platform and then to install the 5.0.3
2. Upgrade is available only from 5.0.2 under some limitations (please read the release notes ) -e.g.- reinstall applications is needed (to those that see errors due to a missing store procedure) 
3. When omnipage is in use the latest OCRs are required (mention in the release notes)

It is very important to read the release notes before installing this version.
