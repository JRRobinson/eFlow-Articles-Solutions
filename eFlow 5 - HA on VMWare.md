# **eFlow 5 - HA on VMWare** #

## **Question / Description** ##

Has anyone of you implemented HA on a VMWare?

Understand for eFLOW 4.5 we can only have Active – Passive setup, whilst in eFLOW 5 we can have Active/Active or the Active – Passive setup.

Could you share how does the setup looks like?

Some information that I would like to know:

•	Does it require any physical SAN storage?

•	Does it require metaSAN or any other SAN virtualisation software?

•	Does VMWare support windows clustering (Microsoft Cluster Service)? Well according to a few sources in the internet, it seems VMWare supports the Microsoft Cluster Service; just want to check with you guys if anyone of you have similar setup.
Thanks in advance!!

## **Answer / Solution** ##

An update:

Attached you can find a few pages related to eFLOW 5 documentation done for an RFI, which is related to HA.

I don’t see how VMware could somehow limit the possibilities of HA, when compared to physical solutions : afaik it should serve the same without restrictions.
