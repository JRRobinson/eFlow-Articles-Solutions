# **eFLOW 4.5 - Removing "base columns" in controller ** #

## **Question / Description** ##

It is possible to select a column which is not a metatag and drag it outside of the controller and by that to remove the column.

It seem that this is application specific, so if I’ll navigate to a different application in the controller the tag will appear.

But, when I return to the “removed” application the tag is not there.

It is not controlled by the plugin to select columns..

Does anyone know how to “bring it back”?

## **Answer / Solution** ##

The changes are saved in your profile: sth. like <C:\Users\Alon.Fux\AppData\Local\TIS\Controller\>. Delete only the application configuration  file.

Deleted the application xml and the columns are back.
