# **eFlow 5 - Some help with SLA needed** #

## **Question / Description** ##

I need to reproduce a case to R&D, and for that I need to assign different SLAs to some of the collections.
Not having (any) experience with the SLA topic – I have a question – is there a way to assign some SLAs manually to couple of collections?

Just to show you the level of knowledge that I am right now – I tried – as seen on the screenshot before – to assign the SLA based on the metatag – but the SLA for the collection didn’t change in the Workflow database.

## **Answer / Solution** ##

I added another sla with AmountDue <> 375.63, reprocessed through Recognition and now I have 2 different SLAs assigned…

Took shorter to solve than expected
