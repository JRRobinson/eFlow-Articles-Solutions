## eFlow 5 -DOMAIN Question 2 ##

### Question/ description: ###
Can we have eFlow 5 Server in an AD domain being accessed by eFlow clients (Validate, Export, etc...) running on PCs in another domain? 

### Answer: ###
Amos> If you have Windows 2008 R2 onwards and use ADFS then is possible. Have not tried that but theory and technology based on this is workable.

Worst case, you could even customized STS to achieve what you want.
