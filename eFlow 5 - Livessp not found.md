# **eFlow 5 - Livessp not found** #

## **Question / Description** ##

We installed eflow5 then obtained the license. Empty.cab imported via Administrate. We always got the attached error when trying to open any of the stations.



## **Answer / Solution** ##

There is a permission problem in win 8 that refer to the eflow user. 

It's a known issue and we might need to release new build for that ( On win 7 you won't see the problem). 

I just discuss this again with the QA manager and it seems that you can try to delete\ disable the LiveSSP option from running on machines with Win8( On Win 7 it will works fine). 

The R&D will fix this issue but it won't be in the next eflow 5 release.
