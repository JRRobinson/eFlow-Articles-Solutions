# **eFLOW 4.5 - FullPage engine result ** #

## **Question / Description** ##

I have a full page engine, which is ABBY. This (full page engine) is configured in VD exactly also as a field engine, which I just created on the fly in order to see benefits of such a configuration : I mean for testing it there in VD.

Well, the field engine has a perfect outcome :

But when the same configuration is used at Full Page level, same engine same settings, as you can see from the below image my 18,35 is not grabbed, but only part of it ( see rectangle on “,35” which is also badly read, as it reads a “m”)

I do not know, understand what / why the same engine behaves differently when it moves from field to full page level……….

Anyone knows, and maybe has a suggestion for solving this ?


## **Answer / Solution** ##

Try the property Use Clean Procedure in the full page engine level, checked. I have got better results with this property checked with some engines. I know in the training material there is a statement saying we should not use this option checked, but make a big difference in a project I did in the past. Play with this property and check the results.
