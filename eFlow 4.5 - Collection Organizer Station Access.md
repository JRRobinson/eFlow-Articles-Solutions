# **eFlow 4.5 - Collection Organizer Station Access** #

### **Question/Description:** ###

I have found a sample code with the following line

using IStationAccess = TiS.Applications.CollectionOrganizer.StationAccess;

I have added references too many dlls like TiS.CollectionOrganizer, TiS.CollectionOrganizer.UI, etc, but I cant find the one with this interface, Some of you know what I need to add to my Project references?

### **Answer/Solution:** ###

I needed to add the efCollectionOrganizer.exe, this was completely new for me, I never needed to add an exectuable as reference.
