# **eFlow 4.5 with Kofax VRS 5.1.0** #

## **Question / Description** ##

Has anyone tried eFlow 4.5 Scanportal with Kofax VRS 5.1.0?  

When we tried, VRS shows up as a scanner to select, but when I select it the Scanner Settings Dialogue box disappears without selecting anything

It is a demo version of VRS 5.1.0. Is it because of that?
  

        

## **Answer / Solution** ##

I tried it before but be EXTREMELY careful not to register it.  You must at least have it that comes with the Scanner that has VRS, it will provide you with the OEM VRS which is completely workable, but never believe the registration.  I did it before with one of the laptops and there is no code to activate after the registration and the registration site remembers the machine that has it registered even uninstall and install again or change machine name, tried deleting the registries – no use at least.

Your OEM VRS may be outdated but your scanner brand website should have the upgrade version to upgrade but you must have the OEM VRS installed first.

First of all, you need to use the Console to set the Scanner model.  Then close it.  After which use Scan portal to select “Kofax VRS Scanner”, then here you go….

Attached is the report of VRS testing which I had done for SCB in the past, using FLOW 4.5.  Today it still works in win8.1 using eFLOW 5.1 scan portal, I have it working directly at my laptop Win8.1.
