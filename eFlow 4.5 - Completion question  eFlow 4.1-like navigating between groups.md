# **eFlow 4.5 - Completion question : eFlow 4.1-like navigating between groups ** #

## **Question / Description** ##

I have a question from customer which was using 4.1 until now and is switching to 4.5.

In 4.1 Completion when working in group mode one could press PageUp/PageDown to move to next/previous group. 
 
It does not work that way in new Completion and they are asking to provide customization to make it the same way.

Is that possible? Do we have any method to navigate between groups in group mode (assuming of course, that validations will let us to skip current group in case of moving forward)?
 
Do we have list of available Completion commands somewhere? 

## **Answer / Solution** ##

Press Create New

The additional commands will be added
