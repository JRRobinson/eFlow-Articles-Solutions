# **eFlow 4.5 - AutoRun definition stored in cab? ** #

## **Question / Description** ##

Is somehow the definition of autoruns stored in a backuped cab file?

After reinstallation of cab the autoruns are lost and they havenâ€™t got saved/exported upfront.


## **Answer / Solution** ##

You could create a script that would call eFlowCmd.exe AutorunEntryAdd to add stations after reinstalling the app.


You can create a script like the one below, that uses eflowCmd. The Autorun information is not in the CAB. In Eflow 4.5 they were written to systemdata file and in Eflow 5, they are written to a database table called E_PreconfiguredStation.

cd "C:\Program Files (x86)\TIS\eFlow 5\Bin"
