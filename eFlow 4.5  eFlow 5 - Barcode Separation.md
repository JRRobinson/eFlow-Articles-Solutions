# **eFlow 4.5 / eFlow 5 - Barcode Separation** #

## **Question / Description** ##

I am trying to separate collections using the Barcode (FilePortal and ScanPortal).  All the configurations that I set in IRSettingsGlobal.xml are not applied ot the stations.


## **Answer / Solution** ##

You can refer to the document see the link below,  this was created for IR 4.5 and has worked correctly.  The document also shows you how to configure IR to read the barcode value into the Client and BUKRS fields if required.
