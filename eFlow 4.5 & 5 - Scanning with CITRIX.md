## eFlow 4.5 & 5 - Scanning with CITRIX ##


### Question/ description: ###

Was anyone of you being faced by the request to do scanning via a CITRIX session, meaning:

- start CITRIX session on a local computer (this might be the eFlow client with Scanportal from CITRIX)
- Run Scanportal and do scanning from there, as usual scan client

What I saw so far is, install scanner driver on that local machine and attach the scanner via USB this ensure the visibility of the scanner by computer's OS.

### Answer: ###

Take a look at this note: [CITRIX Note](http://support.citrix.com/article/CTX136395) .

however it talks about Twain, not ISIS. Maybe there could be more information. Maybe enquire from CITRIX to find out more
