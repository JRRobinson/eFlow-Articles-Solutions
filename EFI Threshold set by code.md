# **EFI Threshold set by code** #

## **Question / Description** ##

Is it possible to set/change the EFI threshold (Matching Parameter in “Set EFI Tolerance Parameters”) by code?

## **Answer / Solution** ##

Yes it is possible (you can check this tool created by Krister Persson a long ago [https://git.topimagesystems.com/+tis-america/latam-utilities/latam_tis-efiutility](https://git.topimagesystems.com/+tis-america/latam-utilities/latam_tis-efiutility) ).
 
But, keep in mind you will need to restart all formid stations, because the EFI properties are downloaded only during the startup.
