# ** eFlow 4.5 installator pops up while printing to pdf creator** #

## **Question / Description** ##

Not sure if this is something that we should support, but maybe someone saw this and knows the answer

Windows 8.1 – when trying to print to pdf creator, we get a message below.

Any hints how to avoid that are welcome.

## **Answer / Solution** ##

In my case sometimes it helps (not always though ) to actually reinstall eFlow, but first try ComUnreg/ComReg.

By ‘reinstall eflow’ I mean to let installer do whatever it wants after popping up. You need to have installer files in a specific folder though or to point installer to eFlow installation files.
