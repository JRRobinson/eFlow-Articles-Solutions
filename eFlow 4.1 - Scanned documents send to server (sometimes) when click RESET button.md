# **eFlow 4.1 - Scanned documents send to server (sometimes) when click RESET button ** #

## **Question / Description** ##

This is a production issue from customer using eFlow 4.1.10.
 
Sometimes they use RESET button to delete the scanned pages and to do rescan those pages. They complaining that the scanned documents are sending to server even they press the RESET. This happens sometimes only. Do you have any idea why it behaves like this. There is no customisation on OnReset event.
 
Any hints are much appreciated.



## **Answer / Solution** ##

If I am not wrong then it is a bug.  I recalled that I encountered it before in the past and after the fix patch or updated version, it was resolved.  I suggest that you have your scenario prepared and log a case to the portal otherwise see if there is an updated version or service patch for eFLOW 4.1.
