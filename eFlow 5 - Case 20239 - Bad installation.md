## eFlow 5 - Case 20239 - Bad installation ##

### Question/ description: ###
I did a fresh install of eFlow 5.1 after recommendation from Barry since it contains new features and bug fixes. However, after install I cannot login into eFlow. A login screen is shown and no matter what account I'm entering it refuses to let me start administrate.

My account is configured in DomainSecurity.xml. Where to start looking?

Installing on my laptop which is running Windows 8 Enterprise.
