# **Completion - On Image Rotation Event** #

## **Question / Description** ##

Is there a way to subscribe to some on page rotation event which happens after user rotates an image?

I would like to be notified and call some function when it happens

Is there a way to save image rotated as per user decision?  So if user rotates image in the completion TIFF will be rotated accordingly and subsequent station will see the change.


## **Answer / Solution** ##

Yes, there are plugins that do this.

Note: No clue if this would still work today
