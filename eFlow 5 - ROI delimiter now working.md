# **eFlow 5 - ROI delimiter now working?** #

## **Question / Description** ##

I need to use ROI delimiter (Integra application) in 5.1.0.14, but it seems it does not work.

I tried to set different delimiters, drag collection back to Integra Activity and nothing is changing.

ROIs are still contatenated without any delimiters.
 
Anyone having similar issue?

## **Answer / Solution** ##

This s a known issue in 5.1 and there is already a ticket open on it (14943)
