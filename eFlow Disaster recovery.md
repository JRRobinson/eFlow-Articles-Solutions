# **eFlow Disaster recovery ** #

## **Question / Description** ##

A client wants to setup disaster recovery for their eFLOW servers. The client is considering backing up the server data every hour? 

Iâ€™m looking for some recommendations as to common practices, softwares to be used? 

 

## **Answer / Solution** ##

My recommendation is usually:

- Make sure you can rebuild the machines quickly (i.e. have images, snapshots if you use vms or automated deployments -- yes, 4.5 can be installed silently for example)


Seriously: I consider eFlow an interim system, usually. Most of the collections should just move right through the workflow. Unless your project is totally different I'd say: Convince the client that they should have a backup of the input files, should be able to recreate the eFlow machines (biggest issue will be: How do you get a production license in an hour) and .. forget about the rest.

Worst case scenario: The collections in your flow are gone. Recreate them from the input backup, eat the additional typing effort if necessary. Back of the envelope calculation: How many collections do you have in your system at any point in time? How many of those contain information that was user-generated (i.e. not just a collection that sits in a queue, a collection that contains completion information)?

I'd say the number is too low to warrant a big backup plan.

Issues with the statement above:

- If you use a scanportal, everything changes (getting out a specific piece of paper sucks. Finding a TIF to import again should be trivial)

- I assume that the company has a way to create a diff (What part of the workload of today and yesterday was already correctly processed) that is reasonably cheap and easy.
