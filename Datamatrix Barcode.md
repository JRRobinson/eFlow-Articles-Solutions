I understand that QS Engine seems to be the best for this, Can anyone share with me the tuned engine parameters to make it work?



## **Answer / Solution** ##

Only QS is able to do so, Input portal has such barcode capability out of the box, using pixtools

No extra customization required.  Only an extra license, from the license portal.
